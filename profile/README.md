## About Us

Vayusoft Labs is a deep-tech company engaged in **Extreme Computing**, dedicated to making Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations fast, reliable, and accessible.

Incorporated in 2024 as a start-up from **IIT Kanpur**, we utilize AI-native, GPU-enabled CFD softwares to deliver high-fidelity results at a fraction of the computational cost of legacy solvers. Our proprietary technology enables rapid design iterations for industries including Aerospace, Energy, EVs, and Climate-Tech.

We address the high cost and slowness of legacy CFD through a vertically integrated approach:

* **10-100x Faster Simulations:** Leveraging GPU acceleration and pseudo-spectral methods to drastically reduce time-to-solution.
* **AI-Native CFD Engine:** Integrating machine learning with traditional physics solvers for enhanced turbulence diagnostics and speed.
* **Hybrid Cloud Scalability:** Seamlessly scalable across GPU clusters and multi-CPU systems, available via a "Pay-as-you-use" cloud service.
* **Patent-Protected:** Backed by unique software-hardware patent.
